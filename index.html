                    <p cite="https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/" class="rule">The objective is to attempt to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible by "hitting" or "standing", without going over 21. You must also get higher than the dealer.</p>

                    <p class="rule">It is up to the player whether an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10, and any other card is its pip value.</p>

                    <p class="rule-sub">Hitting or Standing</p>
                    <p class="rule">You must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card) or "hit" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly). Thus, a player may stand on the two cards originally dealt to them, or they may ask the dealer for additional cards, one at a time, until deciding to stand on the total (if it is 21 or under), or goes "bust" (if it is over 21).</p>
